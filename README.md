# hidden-code-web-site

A simple site implementation of the video from [PwnFunction's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msdymgkhePo).

When going to the site, you'll get a page with no code when you inspect the page's source code.
That is only if you use a firefox browser or a fork of it. If you use chrome, you'll get a white page.

After 5 seconds, you will be redirected to a [youtube video with a guy that can't stop playing code while there's an earthquaque](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1GeSlydcrM).

# run

You will need python and pip.

if you don't have flask, install it using `pip`:
```
pip install flask
```

run the server:
```
python3 main.py
```
You might need administrator's permission, so if you get an error, and if you're on linux, just type this:
```
sudo !!
```
for running the previous command on sudo permission.
